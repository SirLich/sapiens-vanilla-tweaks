Vanilla Tweaks mod adds a collection tweaks to the base game. 

This mod was designed to replace one-off mods that simply tweaked a single thing to a set value.

Every 'tweak' can be set in-game, in real-time, whilst playing Sapiens. The values will also be saved between runs. If you want to revert a change, the 'default value' button will always revert to the original game value.

In the future I will be adding more tweaks. Please get in touch: https://discord.gg/WnN8hj2Fyg

------------------------------------
TIME TWEAKS
------------------------------------

Time Tweaks allow you to tweak how fast time passes, in the various modes. For example, you could make pause speed go forward at 0.01% speed, instead of a true pause.

 - Pause Speed
 - Play Speed
 - Fast Forward Speed
 - Ultra Speed
 - Slow Motion Speed

------------------------------------
PROGRESSION TWEAKS
------------------------------------

These tweaks control how quickly you can move through the games tech tree by adjusting Sapiens capabilities:
 -  Max Orders per Follow: How many orders each Sapien can "queue" before it complains you have too many orders.
 -  Max Roles:  How many skills/roles you can assign to each Sapien.

------------------------------------
MOVEMENT TWEAKS
------------------------------------

These tweaks are for the player.

  - Unlock Player Height: Fly as high as you want! No more height limit. 
  - Remove Movement Bounds: Fly very far away from Sapiens. No more invisible wall.|

------------------------------------
SAPIEN TWEAKS
------------------------------------

Final category covers a lot of tweaks related to Sapiens themselves. I will add more soon. I especially want to add tweaks for pregnancy. 

 - Normalize Walk Speed: Removes the walk-speed debuff that old people get. 
 - Walk Speed Multiplier: A direct multiplier to the sapiens walk speed. Does not effect work-speed. 
 - Hunger Multiplier: How quickly sapiens get hungry. 0 to turn off hunger.
 - Music Need Multiplier: How much sapiens need music. 0 to turn off the need.
 - Injury Duration: How long Sapiens are injured after being hurt. 0 to heal instantly.
 - Time to Become Wet: How long Sapiens must be in the rain before getting wet status. 
 - Time to Become Dry: How long Sapiens must be out of the rain before the wet status goes away.
