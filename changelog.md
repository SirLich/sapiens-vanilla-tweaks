The first release of vanilla tweaks, offering a variety of tweak options. Powered by Hammerstones 'Save State' system.

# 1.0.0

 - 'Ultra Speed' tweak can now go up to 2,000 instead of 1,000
 - Introduced tweaks for birth rate, birth duration, and infant duration
 - Fixed injury duration from default of 400, to default of 2880. I believe this was a bug.
 - Added burn, virus, and food poison duration
 - Removed 'Normalize Walk Speed'. This was actually buggy and was the reverse of expected.
