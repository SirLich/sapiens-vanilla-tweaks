# Sapiens Vanilla Tweaks

## About

This Sapiens mod allows real-time, in-game editing of many game 'constants'. The idea is give the user full control over their Sapiens experience.

In a nutshell, this mod is intending to replace the proliferation of small mods that simply change a single constant to a new (usually higher) set value.
